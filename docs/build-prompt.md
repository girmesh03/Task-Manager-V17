## YOUR OBJECTIVE

Build a **complete, production-ready Multi-Tenant SaaS Task Manager** application that:

1. **Implements Multi-Tenancy**: Strict data isolation between customer organizations with platform organization oversight
2. **Manages Three Task Types**: ProjectTask (outsourced to vendors), RoutineTask (from outlets, materials direct), AssignedTask (to users)
3. **Enforces Role-Based Access**: Four roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Manager, User) with granular permissions
4. **Provides Real-Time Updates**: Socket.IO for instant notifications and data synchronization
5. **Ensures Data Integrity**: Soft delete with cascade operations, transaction-based writes, comprehensive validation
6. **Delivers Excellent UX**: Responsive design, optimized performance, intuitive workflows

## CONTEXT: UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM

### Platform Organization

A **Platform Organization** is the service provider that manages the entire SaaS system:

- **Identifier**: `isPlatformOrg: true` (immutable field in Organization model)
- **Purpose**: Oversees all customer organizations, manages system-wide operations
- **Quantity**: Exactly ONE platform organization exists in the system
- **Creation**: Created via backend seed data during initial system setup
- **Users**: All users in platform organization have `isPlatformUser: true` (auto-set)
- **Special Access**: Platform SuperAdmin can view and manage ALL customer organizations (crossOrg scope)
- **Deletion Protection**: Platform organization CANNOT be deleted (hard-coded protection)
- **TTL**: Never expires (no automatic cleanup)
- **Use Case**: System administrators, support staff, platform management team

### Customer Organization

A **Customer Organization** is a regular tenant using the platform:

- **Identifier**: `isPlatformOrg: false` (default value in Organization model)
- **Purpose**: Independent business entity using the task management system
- **Quantity**: Multiple customer organizations can exist
- **Creation**: Created via frontend registration/onboarding process
- **Users**: All users in customer organization have `isPlatformUser: false` (auto-set)
- **Data Isolation**: Completely isolated from other customer organizations
- **Access Scope**: Customer SuperAdmin can only access own organization (crossDept scope within org)
- **Deletion**: CAN be deleted (soft delete with cascade to all related data)
- **TTL**: Never expires (no automatic cleanup)
- **Use Case**: Companies, businesses, teams using the platform as tenants

## TENANT HIERARCHY AND MULTI-TENANCY

### Organizational Structure

Organizations → Departments → Users

### Platform vs Customer Organizations

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

**Platform Organization:**

- Identifier: `isPlatformOrg: true` (immutable field)
- Purpose: Service provider organization managing the entire system
- Quantity: ONLY ONE platform organization exists
- Creation: Backend seed data during initial setup
- Users: All have `isPlatformUser: true` (automatically set)
- Access: Platform SuperAdmin can view/manage ALL customer organizations
- TTL: Never expires (TTL = null)
- Deletion: CANNOT be deleted (hard-coded protection)

**Customer Organization:**

- Identifier: `isPlatformOrg: false` (default)
- Purpose: Regular tenant organizations using the platform
- Quantity: Multiple customer organizations
- Creation: Frontend registration/onboarding process
- Users: All have `isPlatformUser: false` (automatically set)
- Access: Completely isolated from other customer organizations
- TTL: Never expires (TTL = null)
- Deletion: CAN be deleted (soft delete with cascade)

**Platform Organization Structure:**

```
Platform Organization (isPlatformOrg: true)
├── Department 1
│   ├── User 1 (isPlatformUser: true, role: SuperAdmin, isHod: true)
│   ├── User 2 (isPlatformUser: true, role: Admin, isHod: false)
│   ├── User 3 (isPlatformUser: true, role: Manager, isHod: false)
│   └── User 4 (isPlatformUser: true, role: User, isHod: false)
└── Resources (Tasks, Materials, Vendors, etc.)
```

**Customer Organization Structure:**

```
Customer Organization (isPlatformOrg: false)
├── Department 1
│   ├── User 1 (isPlatformUser: false, role: SuperAdmin, isHod: true)
│   ├── User 2 (isPlatformUser: false, role: Admin, isHod: false)
│   ├── User 3 (isPlatformUser: false, role: Manager, isHod: false)
│   └── User 4 (isPlatformUser: false, role: User, isHod: false)
└── Resources (Tasks, Materials, Vendors, etc.)
```

### Head of Department (HOD) Rules

**Definition:** Users with SuperAdmin or Admin roles are automatically designated as Head of Department.

**Characteristics:**

- `isHod: true` for SuperAdmin and Admin roles (automatically set)
- `isHod: false` for Manager and User roles (automatically set)
- Uniqueness: Only ONE HOD (SuperAdmin or Admin) per department
- Enforced at database level with unique index
- Special Privilege: Only HOD users can be watchers on ProjectTasks

**HOD Assignment:**

- SuperAdmin: Always HOD (`isHod: true`)
- Admin: Always HOD (`isHod: true`)
- Manager: Never HOD (`isHod: false`)
- User: Never HOD (`isHod: false`)

**Deletion Protection:**

- Cannot delete last HOD in department
- System checks HOD count before allowing deletion
- Ensures every department has at least one HOD

**Watcher Eligibility:**

- Only HOD users can be watchers on ProjectTasks
- Validation enforced at task creation/update
- Non-HOD users cannot be added as watchers

**Automatic Updates:**

- Changing user role to SuperAdmin/Admin automatically sets `isHod: true`
- Changing user role to Manager/User automatically sets `isHod: false`
- Pre-save hook handles automatic updates

### Role-Based Access Control

**Roles (Descending Privileges):**

1. SuperAdmin (Platform & Organization Level)
2. Admin (Organization Level)
3. Manager (Department Level)
4. User (Standard)

**Platform SuperAdmin:**

- Organization Access: ALL organizations (platform + all customers)
- Department Access: All departments in all organizations
- User Access: All users in all organizations
- Resource Access: All resources in all organizations
- Special Permissions: Create/manage customer organizations, view cross-organization data
- Scope: `crossOrg` for Organization resource, `crossDept` for all other resources

**Customer SuperAdmin:**

- Organization Access: Own organization ONLY
- Department Access: All departments in own organization
- User Access: All users in own organization
- Resource Access: All resources in own organization
- Special Permissions: Create/manage departments, manage all users in organization
- Scope: `crossDept` (cannot access other organizations)

**Platform Admin:**

- Organization Access: Platform organization ONLY
- Department Access: All departments in platform organization
- User Access: All users in platform organization
- Resource Access: All resources in platform organization
- Special Permissions: Same as Customer Admin (no cross-org access)
- Scope: `crossDept` within platform organization

**Customer Admin:**

- Organization Access: Own organization ONLY
- Department Access: All departments in own organization
- User Access: All users in own organization
- Resource Access: All resources in own organization
- Special Permissions: Manage users, view cross-department resources
- Scope: `crossDept` within own organization

**Manager (Platform or Customer):**

- Organization Access: Own organization (read-only)
- Department Access: Own department ONLY
- User Access: Users in own department
- Resource Access: Resources in own department

- Scope: `ownDept`

**User (Platform or Customer):**

- Organization Access: Own organization (read-only)
- Department Access: Own department (read-only)
- User Access: Users in own department (read-only)
- Resource Access: Resources in own department (read-only for materials/vendors)
- Special Permissions: Create/manage own tasks
- Scope: `ownDept` (read), `own` (write)

### Multi-Tenancy Isolation

**Data Isolation:**

- Customer organizations are completely isolated from each other
- No customer organization can access another customer organization's data
- Database queries automatically scoped to user's organization
- Authorization middleware enforces organization boundaries
- Exception: Platform SuperAdmin can access all organizations

**Query Scoping Examples:**

```javascript
// Platform SuperAdmin/Admin query (can access all organizations for read/delete/restore operation)
{
  isDeleted: false
}

// Platform SuperAdmin/Admin query (can access all organizations for all operation except read/delete/restore)
{
  organization: user.organization._id,
   department: user.department._id,
  isDeleted: false
}

// Customer SuperAdmin/Admin query (scoped to own organization for only read operation)
{
  organization: user.organization._id,
  isDeleted: false
}

// Customer SuperAdmin/Admin query (scoped to own organization and department)
{
  organization: user.organization._id,
  department: user.department._id,
  isDeleted: false
}

// Manager/User query (scoped to own department)
{
  organization: user.organization._id,
  department: user.department._id,
  isDeleted: false
}
```

## SOFT DELETE PLUGIN (UNIVERSAL)

**File:** `backend/models/plugins/softDelete.js`

**Purpose:** Universal soft delete functionality for ALL models

**Fields Added to Every Model:**

```javascript
{
  isDeleted: { type: Boolean, default: false, index: true },
  deletedAt: { type: Date, default: null, index: true },
  deletedBy: { type: ObjectId, ref: "User", default: null, index: true },
  restoredAt: { type: Date, default: null },
  restoredBy: { type: ObjectId, ref: "User", default: null },: { type: Number, default: 0 }
}
```

**Query Helpers:**

- `withDeleted()`: Include soft-deleted documents in query
- `onlyDeleted()`: Return only soft-deleted documents

**Instance Methods:**

- `softDelete(deletedBy, { session })`: Soft delete this document
- `restore(restoredBy, { session })`: Restore this document

**Static Methods:**

- `softDeleteById(id, { session, deletedBy })`: Soft delete by ID
- `softDeleteMany(filter, { session, deletedBy })`: Soft delete multiple
- `restoreById(id, { session, restoredBy })`: Restore by ID
- `restoreMany(filter, { session, restoredBy })`: Restore multiple
- `findDeletedByIds(ids, { session })`: Find soft-deleted documents
- `countDeleted(filter, { session })`: Count soft-deleted documents
- `ensureTTLIndex(expireAfterSeconds)`: Create TTL index for auto-cleanup
- `getRestoreAudit(id, { session })`: Get restore audit trail

**Automatic Filtering:**

- All queries automatically filter out soft-deleted documents unless `withDeleted()` is used
- `find({})` excludes soft-deleted
- `find({}).withDeleted()` includes soft-deleted
- `find({}).onlyDeleted()` only soft-deleted

**Hard Delete Protection:**

- `deleteOne()` - Blocked (throws error)
- `deleteMany()` - Blocked (throws error)
- `findOneAndDelete()` - Blocked (throws error)
- `remove()` - Blocked (throws error)

**TTL Configuration (Auto-Expiry After Soft Delete):**

- Users: 365 days
- Tasks (all types): 180 days
- TaskActivity: 90 days
- TaskComment: 90 days
- Organizations: Never (TTL = null)
- Departments: 365 days
- Materials: 180 days
- Vendors: 180 days
- Attachments: 90 days
- Notifications: 30 days

**Cascade Delete Operations:**

- ALL cascade operations MUST use MongoDB transactions
- Cascade order documented for each model
- Parent deletion cascades to all children
- Restore does NOT automatically restore children (manual restore required)

## AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY

### JWT Token System

**Access Token:**

- Expiry: 15 minutes
- Secret: `process.env.JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` (min 32 chars)
- Storage: HTTP-only cookie named `access_token`
- Purpose: Short-lived token for API requests

**Refresh Token:**

- Expiry: 7 days
- Secret: `process.env.JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` (min 32 chars)
- Storage: HTTP-only cookie named `refresh_token`
- Purpose: Long-lived token for refreshing access tokens
- Rotation: New refresh token issued on each refresh

**Cookie Configuration:**

```javascript
{
  httpOnly: true,              // Prevents JavaScript access (XSS protection)
  secure: isProduction,        // HTTPS only in production
  sameSite: 'strict',          // CSRF protection
  maxAge: 15 * 60 * 1000,      // 15 minutes (access token)
  maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // 7 days (refresh token)
}
```

### Password Security

**Hashing (bcrypt):**

```javascript
// Hash password on user creation/update
userSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
  if (this.isModified("password")) {
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 12); // 12 salt rounds
  }
  next();
});

// Compare entered password with hash
userSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function (enteredPassword) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(enteredPassword, this.password);
};
```

**Requirements:**

- Minimum 8 characters
- Bcrypt with ≥12 salt rounds
- Never stored in plain text
- Never returned in API responses (select: false)

**Password Reset:**

- Generate random reset token
- Hash token with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Store hashed token in user document
- Set expiry (1 hour)
- Send reset email with unhashed token
- Always return success (prevents email enumeration)

### Authorization Matrix

**File:** `backend/config/authorizationMatrix.json`

**Structure:**

```json
{
  "Resource": {
    "Role": {
      "operation": ["scope1", "scope2"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Operations:**

- `create`: Create new resources
- `read`: View resources
- `update`: Modify resources
- `delete`: Soft delete resources

**Scopes:**

- `own`: User's own resources only
- `ownDept`: Resources in user's department
- `crossDept`: Resources across departments in organization
- `crossOrg`: Resources across organizations (platform SuperAdmin only)

**Note:** Platform SuperAdmin has `crossOrg` scope for Organization resource only. All other resources use `crossDept` as maximum scope.

### Permission Fields in Schemas

**CRITICAL:** Each schema has specific permission-related fields that control access and ownership:

**Organization Schema:**

- `createdBy` (ref: User) - User who created the organization (permission: track createdBy)
- `isPlatformOrg` (Boolean, immutable) - Platform organization flag (permission: crossOrg access for platform SuperAdmin)

**Department Schema:**

- `organization` (ref: Organization, required) - Parent organization (permission: organization-level isolation)
- `createdBy` (ref: User) - User who created the department (permission: track createdBy)

**User Schema:**

- `role` (enum: SuperAdmin/Admin/Manager/User) - User's role (permission: determines authorization scope)
- `organization` (ref: Organization, required) - User's organization (permission: organization-level isolation)
- `department` (ref: Department, required) - User's department (permission: department-level isolation)
- `isPlatformUser` (Boolean, immutable, auto-set) - Platform user flag (permission: crossOrg access for platform users)
- `isHod` (Boolean, auto-set from role) - Head of Department flag (permission: watcher eligibility on ProjectTasks)

**BaseTask Schema (All Task Types):**

- `organization` (ref: Organization, required) - Task's organization (permission: organization-level isolation)
- `department` (ref: Department, required) - Task's department (permission: department-level isolation)
- `createdBy` (ref: User, required) - Task createdBy (permission: ownership for update/delete)
- `watchers` (array of User refs, max 20, unique) - HOD users watching task (permission: only HOD users allowed)

**ProjectTask Schema:**

- `assignees` (array of User refs, max 20, unique) - Users assigned to task (permission: assignee access)
- `vendor` (ref: Vendor, required) - Vendor handling task (permission: vendor-specific access)

**RoutineTask Schema:**

- No additional permission fields (inherits from BaseTask)

**AssignedTask Schema:**

- `assignees` (ref: User or array of Users, required) - User(s) assigned to task included in assignees array (permission: assignee access)

**TaskActivity Schema:**

- `parent` (ref: ProjectTask or AssignedTask) - Parent task (permission: task-level access)
- `createdBy` (ref: User, required) - Activity createdBy (permission: ownership)
- `department` (ref: Department, required) - Activity's department (permission: department-level isolation)
- `organization` (ref: Organization, required) - Activity's organization (permission: organization-level isolation)

**TaskComment Schema:**

- `parent` (ref: Task/TaskActivity/TaskComment) - Parent entity (permission: parent-level access)
- `mentions` (array of User refs, max 5) - Mentioned users (permission: notification access)
- `createdBy` (ref: User, required) - Comment createdBy (permission: ownership)
- `department` (ref: Department, required) - Comment's department (permission: department-level isolation)
- `organization` (ref: Organization, required) - Comment's organization (permission: organization-level isolation)

**Material Schema:**

- `department` (ref: Department, required) - Material's department (permission: department-level isolation)
- `organization` (ref: Organization, required) - Material's organization (permission: organization-level isolation)
- `addedBy` (ref: User) - User who added material (permission: track createdBy)
- `vendor` (ref: Vendor) - Associated vendor (permission: vendor-specific access)

**Vendor Schema:**

- `department` (ref: Department, required) - Vendor's department (permission: department-level isolation)
- `organization` (ref: Organization, required) - Vendor's organization (permission: organization-level isolation)
- `createdBy` (ref: User) - User who created vendor (permission: track createdBy)

**Attachment Schema:**

- `parent` (ref: Task/TaskActivity/TaskComment) - Parent entity (permission: parent-level access)
- `uploadedBy` (ref: User, required) - User who uploaded file (permission: ownership)

- `entity` (ref: any resource) - Related entity (permission: entity-level access)

**Permission Field Usage Rules:**

1. **Organization Isolation**: All queries MUST filter by `organizationId` (except platform SuperAdmin with crossOrg)
2. **Department Isolation**: Queries MUST filter by `departmentId` for Manager/User roles
3. **Ownership**: `createdBy`, `addedBy`, `uploadedBy` fields determine ownership for update/delete operations
4. **Role-Based**: `role` field determines authorization scope (own, ownDept, crossDept, crossOrg)
5. **Platform Flag**: `isPlatformOrg` and `isPlatformUser` enable crossOrg access for platform organization
6. **HOD Flag**: `isHod` determines watcher eligibility on ProjectTasks
7. **Assignment**: `assignees` fields grant task access to assigned users
8. **Mentions**: `mentions` field grants notification access to mentioned users
9. **Watchers**: `watchers` field grants task visibility to HOD users

### Security Middleware Order (CRITICAL)

**File:** `backend/app.js`

**Order matters for security:**

1. **helmet** - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, hide X-Powered-By)
2. **cors** - Cross-origin resource sharing (origin validation, credentials enabled, no wildcards in production)
3. **cookieParser** - Parse cookies (required before authentication middleware)
4. **express.json** - Parse JSON bodies (10mb limit for file uploads)
5. **mongoSanitize** - NoSQL injection prevention (removes $ and . from user input)
6. **compression** - Response compression (gzip for responses >1KB)
7. **rateLimiter** - Rate limiting (production only: 100 req/15min general, 5 req/15min auth)

### Rate Limiting (Production Only)

**General API Limiter:**

```javascript
{
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // 15 minutes
  max: 100,                   // 100 requests per window
  message: "Too many requests, please try again later",
  standardHeaders: true,      // Return rate limit info in headers
  keyGenerator: (req) => req.ip  // Track by IP address
}
```

**Auth Endpoints Limiter:**

```javascript
{
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // 15 minutes
  max: 5,                     // 5 requests per window
  message: "Too many authentication attempts, please try again later",
  keyGenerator: (req) => req.ip
}
```

**Headers:**

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when limit resets

**Endpoints with Stricter Limits:**

- POST /api/auth/login - 5/15min
- POST /api/auth/register - 5/15min
- POST /api/auth/forgot-password - 5/15min
- POST /api/auth/reset-password - 5/15min
- GET /api/auth/refresh-token - 5/15min
- DELETE /api/auth/logout - 5/15min

### CORS Configuration

**File:** `backend/config/corsOptions.js`

```javascript
{
  origin: validateOrigin,  // Function that validates against allowedOrigins
  credentials: true,       // Enable cookies
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization", "X-Requested-With"],
  exposedHeaders: ["X-Request-ID", "X-RateLimit-Limit", "X-RateLimit-Remaining"],
  maxAge: 86400,          // 24 hours preflight cache
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200,
  preflightContinue: false
}
```

**Allowed Origins:**

- Development: http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173
- Production: process.env.CLIENT_URL + process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- NO wildcards in production

## SOCKET.IO REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION

### Backend Socket.IO Setup

**File:** `backend/utils/socketInstance.js` - Socket.IO Singleton

```javascript
import { Server } from "socket.io";
import corsOptions from "../config/corsOptions.js";

let io = null;

export const initializeSocket = (httpServer) => {
  io = new Server(httpServer, {
    cors: corsOptions,
  });

  setupSocketHandlers(io);
  return io;
};

export const getIO = () => {
  if (!io) {
    throw new Error("Socket.IO not initialized");
  }
  return io;
};
```

**File:** `backend/utils/socket.js` - Socket.IO Event Handlers

**Connection/Disconnection:**

- User connects → joins user, department, organization rooms
- User disconnects → leaves all rooms, status updated to 'Offline'

**Rooms:**

- `user:${userId}` - User-specific events
- `department:${department}` - Department-wide events
- `organization:${organization}` - Organization-wide events

**File:** `backend/utils/socketEmitter.js` - Socket.IO Event Emitters

**Event Types:**

- `task:created`, `task:updated`, `task:deleted`, `task:restored`
- `activity:created`, `activity:updated`
- `comment:created`, `comment:updated`, `comment:deleted`
- `notification:created`
- `user:online`, `user:offline`, `user:away`
- `organization:created`, `department:created`, `material:created`, `vendor:created`

**Emit Pattern:**

```javascript
export const emitToRooms = (event, data, rooms) => {
  const io = getIO();
  rooms.forEach((room) => {
    io.to(room).emit(event, data);
  });
};

## FRONTEND UI PATTERNS

### DataGrid Pattern (Admin Views)

**Use For:** Organizations, Departments, Materials, Vendors, Users (admin view)

**When to Use:**

- Resource management pages requiring CRUD operations
- Pages with complex filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Admin-level views with bulk operations
- Data-heavy interfaces with many columns

**Required Files:**

- `*Page.jsx` - Data fetching, state management, filters
- `*Columns.jsx` - Column definitions for DataGrid
- `*Filter.jsx` - Filter UI components (optional)
- `CreateUpdate*.jsx` - Form modal for create/edit operations

**Required Components:**

- `MuiDataGrid` - Auto-converts pagination (0-based MUI ↔ 1-based backend)
- `MuiActionColumn` - Actions (View/Edit/Delete/Restore), auto-detects soft delete
- `CustomDataGridToolbar` - Optional toolbar with export, filters, columns

**Critical DataGrid Rules:**

1. ✅ ALWAYS use server-side pagination (`paginationMode: "server"`)
2. ✅ ALWAYS convert pagination: `page + 1` when sending to backend
3. ✅ ALWAYS pass `loading={isLoading || isFetching}` to show loading state
4. ✅ ALWAYS provide meaningful `emptyMessage`
5. ✅ ALWAYS use `MuiActionColumn` for action buttons (never custom)
6. ✅ ALWAYS set action column: `sortable: false`, `filterable: false`, `disableColumnMenu: true`

**Pattern Structure:**

```jsx
// MaterialsPage.jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useGetMaterialsQuery } from "../redux/features/material/materialApi";
import MuiDataGrid from "../components/common/MuiDataGrid";
import { getMaterialColumns } from "../components/columns/MaterialColumns";
import MaterialFilter from "../components/filters/MaterialFilter";
import CreateUpdateMaterial from "../components/forms/materials/CreateUpdateMaterial";

const MaterialsPage = () => {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({});
  const [pagination, setPagination] = useState({ page: 0, pageSize: 10 });
  const [dialogOpen, setDialogOpen] = useState(false);
  const [selectedMaterial, setSelectedMaterial] = useState(null);

  const { data, isLoading, isFetching } = useGetMaterialsQuery({
    page: pagination.page + 1, // Convert to 1-based for backend
    limit: pagination.pageSize,
    ...filters,
  });

  const handleView = (material) => {
    /* Navigate to detail view */
  };
  const handleEdit = (material) => {
    setSelectedMaterial(material);
    setDialogOpen(true);
  };
  const handleDelete = async (material) => {
    /* Show confirmation, then delete */
  };
  const handleRestore = async (material) => {
    /* Restore soft-deleted material */
  };

  const columns = getMaterialColumns({
    onView: handleView,
    onEdit: handleEdit,
    onDelete: handleDelete,
    onRestore: handleRestore,
  });

  return (
    <Box>
      <MaterialFilter filters={filters} onFiltersChange={setFilters} />
      <MuiDataGrid
        rows={data?.materials || []}
        columns={columns}
        loading={isLoading || isFetching}
        rowCount={data?.pagination?.totalCount || 0}
        paginationModel={pagination}
        onPaginationModelChange={setPagination}
        emptyMessage="No materials found"
      />
      <CreateUpdateMaterial
        open={dialogOpen}
        onClose={() => setDialogOpen(false)}
        material={selectedMaterial}
      />
    </Box>
  );
};
```

**Column Definition Pattern:**

```jsx
// MaterialColumns.jsx
import MuiActionColumn from "../common/MuiActionColumn";

export const getMaterialColumns = (actions) => {
  const { onView, onEdit, onDelete, onRestore } = actions;

  return [
    {
      field: "name",
      headerName: "Name",
      flex: 1,
      minWidth: 150,
    },
    {
      field: "category",
      headerName: "Category",
      width: 150,
    },
    {
      field: "quantity",
      headerName: "Quantity",
      width: 100,
      type: "number",
    },
    {
      field: "unitType",
      headerName: "Unit",
      width: 100,
    },
    {
      field: "cost",
      headerName: "Cost",
      width: 120,
      type: "number",
      valueFormatter: (value) => `${value.toFixed(2)}`,
    },
    {
      field: "actions",
      headerName: "Actions",
      width: 150,
      sortable: false,
      filterable: false,
      disableColumnMenu: true,
      renderCell: (params) => (
        <MuiActionColumn
          row={params.row}
          onView={onView}
          onEdit={onEdit}
          onDelete={onDelete}
          onRestore={onRestore}
        />
      ),
    },
  ];
};
```

### Three-Layer Pattern (User Views)

**Use For:** Tasks, Users (user view), Dashboard widgets

**When to Use:**

- Card-based layouts for better visual hierarchy
- User-facing views (non-admin)
- Mobile-responsive designs
- Content-heavy displays

**Structure:** Page → List → Card

**Layer Responsibilities:**

- **Page**: Data fetching, state management, event handling, routing
- **List**: Layout, mapping items, delegating events to cards
- **Card**: Display single item, memoized for performance

**Critical Three-Layer Rules:**

1. ✅ ALWAYS wrap Card components with `React.memo`
2. ✅ ALWAYS use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to children
3. ✅ ALWAYS use `useMemo` for computed values (dates, colors, etc.)
4. ✅ ALWAYS set `displayName` for memoized components (debugging)
5. ✅ ALWAYS handle empty states in List component
6. ✅ ALWAYS use MUI Grid with `size` prop (NOT `item` prop)

**Pattern Structure:**

```jsx
// TasksPage.jsx (Layer 1: Page)
import { useState } from "react";
import { useGetTasksQuery } from "../redux/features/task/taskApi";
import TasksList from "../components/lists/TasksList";
import TaskFilter from "../components/filters/TaskFilter";

const TasksPage = () => {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({});
  const { data, isLoading } = useGetTasksQuery(filters);

  const handleTaskClick = (task) => {
    navigate(`/tasks/${task._id}`);
  };

  const handleTaskUpdate = (task) => {
    // Open edit dialog
  };

  return (
    <Box>
      <TaskFilter filters={filters} onFiltersChange={setFilters} />
      {isLoading ? (
        <MuiLoading />
      ) : (
        <TasksList
          tasks={data?.tasks || []}
          onTaskClick={handleTaskClick}
          onTaskUpdate={handleTaskUpdate}
        />
      )}
    </Box>
  );
};

// TasksList.jsx (Layer 2: List)
import { Grid } from "@mui/material";
import TaskCard from "../cards/TaskCard";

const TasksList = ({ tasks, onTaskClick, onTaskUpdate }) => {
  if (tasks.length === 0) {
    return <EmptyState message="No tasks found" />;
  }

  return (
    <Grid container spacing={2}>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <Grid key={task._id} size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 4 }}>
          <TaskCard task={task} onClick={onTaskClick} onUpdate={onTaskUpdate} />
        </Grid>
      ))}
    </Grid>
  );
};

// TaskCard.jsx (Layer 3: Card)
import React, { useCallback, useMemo } from "react";
import { Card, CardContent, Typography, Chip } from "@mui/material";
import dayjs from "dayjs";

const TaskCard = React.memo(({ task, onClick, onUpdate }) => {
  // Memoize event handlers
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    onClick(task);
  }, [task, onClick]);

  const handleUpdate = useCallback(
    (e) => {
      e.stopPropagation(); // Prevent card click
      onUpdate(task);
    },
    [task, onUpdate]
  );

  // Memoize computed values
  const formattedDate = useMemo(() => {
    return dayjs(task.createdAt).format("MMM DD, YYYY");
  }, [task.createdAt]);

  const statusColor = useMemo(() => {
    const colors = {
      "To Do": "default",
      "In Progress": "primary",
      Completed: "success",
      Pending: "warning",
    };
    return colors[task.status] || "default";
  }, [task.status]);

  return (
    <Card onClick={handleClick} sx={{ cursor: "pointer", height: "100%" }}>
      <CardContent>
        <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
          {task.title}
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary" gutterBottom>
          {task.description}
        </Typography>
        <Box sx={{ display: "flex", gap: 1, mt: 2 }}>
          <Chip label={task.status} color={statusColor} size="small" />
          <Chip label={task.priority} size="small" />
        </Box>
        <Typography variant="caption" color="text.secondary" sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
          {formattedDate}
        </Typography>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
});

TaskCard.displayName = "TaskCard";

export default TaskCard;
```

### Form Pattern (Create/Update)

**Use For:** All resource creation and editing

**When to Use:**

- Creating new resources
- Editing existing resources
- Multi-step forms (registration)
- Complex validation requirements

**Required Libraries:**

- `react-hook-form` - Form state management
- `@mui/material` - UI components
- Controller from react-hook-form for MUI integration

**Critical Form Rules:**

1. ❌ NEVER use `watch()` method from react-hook-form
2. ✅ ALWAYS use `Controller` for MUI components
3. ✅ ALWAYS use `control` prop from useForm
4. ✅ ALWAYS reset form when material/resource changes
5. ✅ ALWAYS handle both create and edit modes in same component
6. ✅ ALWAYS show loading state during submission
7. ✅ ALWAYS show toast notifications for success/error
8. ✅ ALWAYS validate on submit (not on change for better UX)
9. ✅ ALWAYS match backend validator field names exactly
10. ✅ ALWAYS import constants from utils/constants.js

**Pattern Structure:**

```jsx
// CreateUpdateMaterial.jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useForm, Controller } from "react-hook-form";
import {
  useCreateMaterialMutation,
  useUpdateMaterialMutation,
} from "../../redux/features/material/materialApi";
import MuiDialog from "../common/MuiDialog";
import MuiTextField from "../common/MuiTextField";
import MuiSelectAutocomplete from "../common/MuiSelectAutocomplete";
import { MATERIAL_CATEGORIES, UNIT_TYPES } from "../../utils/constants";
import { toast } from "react-toastify";

const CreateUpdateMaterial = ({ open, onClose, material }) => {
  const isEditMode = Boolean(material);

  const [createMaterial, { isLoading: isCreating }] =
    useCreateMaterialMutation();
  const [updateMaterial, { isLoading: isUpdating }] =
    useUpdateMaterialMutation();

  const {
    control,
    handleSubmit,
    reset,
    formState: { errors },
  } = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      name: "",
      description: "",
      category: "",
      unitType: "",
      price: 0,
    },
  });

  // Reset form when material changes
  useEffect(() => {
    if (material) {
      reset({
        name: material.name || "",
        description: material.description || "",
        category: material.category || "",
        quantity: material.quantity || 0,
        unitType: material.unitType || "",
        price: material.price || 0,
      });
    } else {
      reset();
    }
  }, [material, reset]);

  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    try {
      if (isEditMode) {
        await updateMaterial({ id: material._id, ...data }).unwrap();
        toast.success("Material updated successfully");
      } else {
        await createMaterial(data).unwrap();
        toast.success("Material created successfully");
      }
      onClose();
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error(error.data?.message || "Operation failed");
    }
  };

  return (
    <MuiDialog
      open={open}
      onClose={onClose}
      title={isEditMode ? "Edit Material" : "Create Material"}
      onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}
      submitText={isEditMode ? "Update" : "Create"}
      loading={isCreating || isUpdating}
    >
      <MuiTextField
        {...register("email", {
          required: "Email is required",
          pattern: {
            value: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/,
            message: "Please enter a valid email address",
          },
        })}
        error={errors.email}
        label="Email Address"
        type="email"
        fullWidth
        size="small"
        margin="normal"
        autoComplete="email"
        autoFocus
        startAdornment={<EmailIcon fontSize="small" color="primary" />}
      />
    </MuiDialog>
  );
};

export default CreateUpdateMaterial;
```

---

## VALIDATION PATTERNS

### Client-Side Validation (Frontend)

**Purpose:** Provide immediate feedback to users before submitting to backend

**Critical Rules:**

1. ✅ ALWAYS match backend validation rules exactly
2. ✅ ALWAYS check backend validators for field requirements
3. ✅ ALWAYS use same error messages as backend when possible
4. ✅ ALWAYS validate on submit (not on change for better UX)

**Common Validation Rules:**

```javascript
// Text fields
{
  required: 'Field is required',
  minLength: { value: 3, message: 'Minimum 3 characters' },
  maxLength: { value: 100, message: 'Maximum 100 characters' },
  pattern: { value: /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/, message: 'Alphanumeric only' }
}

// Email
{
  required: 'Email is required',
  pattern: {
    value: /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$/i,
    message: 'Invalid email address'
  }
}

// Number fields
{
  required: 'Field is required',
  min: { value: 0, message: 'Must be positive' },
  max: { value: 100, message: 'Maximum 100' },
  validate: (value) => value > 0 || 'Must be greater than 0'
}

// Custom validation
{
  validate: {
    positive: (value) => value > 0 || 'Must be positive',
    lessThan100: (value) => value < 100 || 'Must be less than 100',
    unique: async (value) => {
      const exists = await checkUnique(value);
      return !exists || 'Already exists';
    }
  }
}
```

### Backend Validation Matching

**Critical:** Frontend validation MUST match backend validators exactly

**Process:**

1. Open backend validator file: `backend/middlewares/validators/*Validators.js`
2. Identify all validation rules for each field
3. Implement identical rules in frontend form
4. Use same error messages when possible

**Example:**

```javascript
// Backend: backend/middlewares/validators/materialValidators.js
body('name')
  .trim()
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Name is required')
  .isLength({ max: 100 }).withMessage('Name must not exceed 100 characters'),

body('quantity')
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Quantity is required')
  .isFloat({ min: 0 }).withMessage('Quantity must be positive'),

// Frontend: client/src/components/forms/materials/CreateUpdateMaterial.jsx
<Controller
  name="name"
  control={control}
  rules={{
    required: 'Name is required',
    maxLength: { value: 100, message: 'Name must not exceed 100 characters' }
  }}
 ...
/>

<Controller
  name="quantity"
  control={control}
  rules={{
    required: 'Quantity is required',
    min: { value: 0, message: 'Quantity must be positive' }
  }}
  ...
/>
```

## TEMPLATE PATTERNS (NO CODE - STRUCTURE ONLY)

### Schema Template Pattern

**File Structure:** `backend/models/ModelName.js`

**Required Imports:**

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import mongoosePaginate from "mongoose-paginate-v2";
import softDeletePlugin from "./plugins/softDelete.js";
```

**Schema Configuration:**

```javascript
const schemaOptions = {
  timestamps: true,
  versionKey: false,
  toJSON: {
    virtuals: true,
    transform: (doc, ret) => {
      delete ret.id;
      return ret;
    },
  },
  toObject: {
    virtuals: true,
    transform: (doc, ret) => {
      delete ret.id;
      return ret;
    },
  },
};
```

**Schema Definition:**

- Define all fields with types, validation, references
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- Add unique indexes for uniqueness constraints
- Add compound indexes for multi-field queries
- Add text indexes for search functionality

**Virtuals:**

- Define virtual fields (e.g., fullName = firstName + lastName)
- Configure virtual populate for relationships

**Pre-Save Hooks (with session support):**

```javascript
schemaName.pre("save", async function (next) {
  // Access session if available: this.$session()
  // Perform pre-save operations
  // Auto-set fields (e.g., isHod based on role)
  // Validate business rules
  next();
});
```

**Pre-Remove Hooks (with session support):**

```javascript
schemaName.pre("remove", async function (next) {
  const session = this.$session();
  // Perform cascade delete operations
  // Use session for all operations
  next();
});
```

**Instance Methods (with session support):**

```javascript
schemaName.methods.methodName = async function (params, { session } = {}) {
  // Method implementation
  // Use session if provided
  // Return result
};
```

**Static Methods (with session support):**

```javascript
schemaName.statics.methodName = async function (params, { session } = {}) {
  // Static method implementation
  // Use session if provided
  // Return result
};
```

**Cascade Delete Static Method (with session support):**

```javascript
schemaName.statics.softDeleteByIdWithCascade = async function (
  id,
  { session, deletedBy } = {}
) {
  // Start transaction if no session provided
  // Soft delete parent
  // Soft delete all children in order
  // Commit transaction
  // Return result
};
```

**Plugin Application:**

```javascript
schemaName.plugin(mongoosePaginate);
schemaName.plugin(softDeletePlugin);
```

**TTL Index:**

```javascript
// After model creation
ModelName.ensureTTLIndex(expireAfterSeconds); // or null for no expiry
```

### Controller Template Pattern

**File Structure:** `backend/controllers/resourceControllers.js`

**Required Imports:**

```javascript
import asyncHandler from "express-async-handler";
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { matchedData } from "express-validator";
import Model from "../models/Model.js";
import CustomError from "../errorHandler/CustomError.js";
```

**Read Controller Pattern (No Session):**

```javascript
export const getResources = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract user context
  const {
    _id: userId,
    role,
    organization,
    department,
    isPlatformUser,
    isHod,
    isPlatformOrg,
  } = req.user;

  // Extract validated query parameters
  const { page, limit, sortBy, sortOrder, search, ...filters } =
    req.validated.query;

  // Build query based on authorization scope
  const query = {};

  // Apply organization isolation (except platform SuperAdmin with crossOrg)
  if (!isPlatformUser || role !== "SuperAdmin") {
    query.organizationId = organizationId;
  }

  // Apply department isolation for Manager/User
  if (role === "Manager" || role === "User") {
    query.departmentId = departmentId;
  }

  // Apply additional filters
  if (search) {
    query.$text = { $search: search };
  }

  // Apply other filters from query params
  Object.assign(query, filters);

  // Pagination options
  const options = {
    page: page || 1,
    limit: limit || 10,
    sort: { [sortBy || "createdAt"]: sortOrder === "asc" ? 1 : -1 },
    populate: [
      /* populate options */
    ],
  };

  // Execute paginated query
  const result = await Model.paginate(query, options);

  // Return response
  res.status(200).json({
    success: true,
    pagination: {
      page: result.page,
      limit: result.limit,
      totalCount: result.totalDocs,
      totalPages: result.totalPages,
      hasNext: result.hasNextPage,
      hasPrev: result.hasPrevPage,
    },
    resources: result.docs,
  });
});
```

**Write Controller Pattern (With Session and Transaction):**

```javascript
export const createResource = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract user context
  const { _id: userId, req.user.organization._id: organizationId, req.user.department._id:departmentId } = req.user;

  // Extract validated body data
  const { field1, field2, field3 } = req.validated.body;

  // Start MongoDB session for transaction
  const session = await mongoose.startSession();
  session.startTransaction();

  try {
    // Validate business rules
    // Check existence of referenced documents (with session)
    const referencedDoc = await ReferencedModel.findById(referenceId).session(
      session
    );
    if (!referencedDoc) {
      throw CustomError.notFound("Referenced document not found");
    }

    // Check uniqueness (with session and withDeleted)
    const existing = await Model.findOne({ uniqueField: value })
      .withDeleted()
      .session(session);
    if (existing) {
      throw CustomError.conflict("Resource already exists");
    }

    // Create resource (with session)
    const resource = await Model.create(
      [
        {
          field1,
          field2,
          field3,
          organizationId,
          departmentId,
          createdBy: userId,
        },
      ],
      { session }
    );

    // Perform related operations (with session)
    // Create notifications, update related documents, etc.

    // Commit transaction
    await session.commitTransaction();

    // Emit Socket.IO event (after successful commit)
    emitResourceEvent("resource:created", resource[0]);

    // Return response
    return res.status(201).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Resource created successfully",
      resource: resource[0],
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback transaction on error
    await session.abortTransaction();
    next(error)
  } finally {
    // End session
    session.endSession();
  }
});
```

**Update Controller Pattern (With Session and Transaction):**

```javascript
export const updateResource = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract user context
  const { _id: userId, role, req.user.organization._id: organizationId, req.user.department._id:departmentId} = req.user;

  // Extract validated params and body
  const { resourceId } = req.validated.params;
  const updateData = req.validated.body;

  // Start MongoDB session for transaction
  const session = await mongoose.startSession();
  session.startTransaction();

  try {
    // Find resource (with session)
    const resource = await Model.findById(resourceId).session(session);
    if (!resource) {
      throw CustomError.notFound("Resource not found");
    }

    // Check authorization (ownership or scope)
    const hasPermission = checkUpdatePermission(req.user, resource);
    if (!hasPermission) {
      throw CustomError.authorization("Insufficient permissions to update this resource");
    }

    // Validate business rules for update
    // Check uniqueness if unique fields are being updated

    // Update resource fields
    Object.assign(resource, updateData);

    // Save resource (with session)
    await resource.save({ session });

    // Perform related operations (with session)

    // Commit transaction
    await session.commitTransaction();

    // Emit Socket.IO event
    emitResourceEvent("resource:updated", resource);

    // Return response
    return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Resource updated successfully",
      resource,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    await session.abortTransaction();
    next(error)
  } finally {
    session.endSession();
  }
});
```

**Delete Controller Pattern (With Session and Cascade):**

```javascript
export const deleteResource = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract user context
  const { _id: userId, role, req.user.organization._id: organizationId, req.user.department._id:departmentId} = req.user;

  // Extract validated params
  const { resourceId } = req.validated.params;

  // Start MongoDB session for transaction
  const session = await mongoose.startSession();
  session.startTransaction();

  try {
    // Find resource (with session)
    const resource = await Model.findById(resourceId).session(session);
    if (!resource) {
      throw CustomError.notFound("Resource not found");
    }

    // Check authorization
    const hasPermission = checkDeletePermission(req.user, resource);
    if (!hasPermission) {
      throw CustomError.authorization("Insufficient permissions to delete this resource");
    }

    // Check deletion constraints (e.g., cannot delete last HOD)

    // Soft delete with cascade (with session)
    await Model.softDeleteByIdWithCascade(resourceId, { session, deletedBy: userId });

    // Commit transaction
    await session.commitTransaction();

    // Emit Socket.IO event
    emitResourceEvent("resource:deleted", resource);

    // Return response
    return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Resource deleted successfully",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    await session.abortTransaction();
    next(error)
  } finally {
    session.endSession();
  }
});
```

**Restore Controller Pattern (With Session):**

```javascript
export const restoreResource = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract user context
  const { _id: userId } = req.user;

  // Extract validated params
  const { resourceId } = req.validated.params;

  // Start MongoDB session for transaction
  const session = await mongoose.startSession();
  session.startTransaction();

  try {
    // Find soft-deleted resource (with session and onlyDeleted)
    const resource = await Model.findById(resourceId)
      .onlyDeleted()
      .session(session);
    if (!resource) {
      throw CustomError.notFound("Deleted resource not found");
    }

    // Check authorization

    // Restore resource (with session)
    await resource.restore(userId, { session });

    // Commit transaction
    await session.commitTransaction();

    // Emit Socket.IO event
    emitResourceEvent("resource:restored", resource);

    // Return response
    return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Resource restored successfully",
      resource,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    await session.abortTransaction();
    next(error);
  } finally {
    session.endSession();
  }
});
```

### Validator Template Pattern

**File Structure:** `backend/middlewares/validators/resourceValidators.js`

**Required Imports:**

```javascript
import { body, param, query } from "express-validator";
import { matchedData } from "express-validator";
import Model from "../../models/Model.js";
import ReferencedModel from "../../models/ReferencedModel.js";
```

**Field Validation Pattern:**

```javascript
// String field with length constraints
body('fieldName')
  .trim()
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Field is required')
  .isLength({ min: 1, max: 100 }).withMessage('Field must be between 1 and 100 characters'),

// Email field
body('email')
  .trim()
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Email is required')
  .isEmail().withMessage('Invalid email format')
  .normalizeEmail({})
  .isLength({ max: 50 }).withMessage('Email must not exceed 50 characters'),

// Number field with range
body('quantity')
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Quantity is required')
  .isFloat({ min: 0 }).withMessage('Quantity must be positive'),

// Enum field
body('status')
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Status is required')
  .isIn(['To Do', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'Pending']).withMessage('Invalid status'),

// Date field
body('dueDate')
  .optional()
  .isISO8601().withMessage('Invalid date format')
  .custom((value, { req }) => {
    if (req.body.startDate && new Date(value) <= new Date(req.body.startDate)) {
      throw new Error('Due date must be after start date');
    }
    return true;
  }),

// Reference field (ObjectId)
body('departmentId')
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Department is required')
  .isMongoId().withMessage('Invalid department ID'),

// Array field
body('tags')
  .optional()
  .isArray().withMessage('Tags must be an array')
  .custom((value) => {
    if (value.length > 5) {
      throw new Error('Maximum 5 tags allowed');
    }
    return true;
  }),
```

**Existence Validation Pattern (with withDeleted):**

```javascript
body('departmentId')
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Department is required')
  .isMongoId().withMessage('Invalid department ID')
  .custom(async (value, { req }) => {
    // Check if department exists (including soft-deleted)
    const department = await Department.findById(value).withDeleted();
    if (!department) {
      throw new Error('Department not found');
    }
    // Check if department is soft-deleted
    if (department.isDeleted) {
      throw new Error('Department is deleted');
    }
    // Check if department belongs to user's organization
    if (department.organizationId.toString() !== req.user.organizationId.toString()) {
      throw new Error('Department does not belong to your organization');
    }
    return true;
  }),
```

**Uniqueness Validation Pattern (with withDeleted):**

```javascript
body('email')
  .trim()
  .notEmpty().withMessage('Email is required')
  .isEmail().withMessage('Invalid email format')
  .custom(async (value, { req }) => {
    // Check uniqueness within organization (including soft-deleted)
    const existing = await User.findOne({
      email: value.toLowerCase(),
      organization: req.user.organization._id,
    }).withDeleted();

    // If updating, exclude current document
    if (existing && (!req.params.id || existing._id.toString() !== req.params.id)) {
      throw new Error('Email already exists in your organization');
    }
    return true;
  }),
```

**Validation Result Handler:**

```javascript
export const handleValidationErrors = (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract validated data from all locations
  req.validated = {
    body: matchedData(req, { locations: ["body"] }),
    params: matchedData(req, { locations: ["params"] }),
    query: matchedData(req, { locations: ["query"] }),
  };

  next();
};
```

**Complete Validator Export:**

```javascript
export const createResourceValidator = [
  // All field validations
  body('field1')...,
  body('field2')...,
  // Validation result handler
  handleValidationErrors,
];

export const updateResourceValidator = [
  param('id').isMongoId().withMessage('Invalid resource ID'),
  // All field validations (optional for update)
  body('field1').optional()...,
  body('field2').optional()...,
  // Validation result handler
  handleValidationErrors,
];
```

### Route Template Pattern

**File Structure:** `backend/routes/resourceRoutes.js`

**Pattern:**

```javascript
import express from "express";
import { verifyJWT } from "../middlewares/authMiddleware.js";
import { authorize } from "../middlewares/authorization.js";
import {
  getResources,
  getResource,
  createResource,
  updateResource,
  deleteResource,
  restoreResource,
} from "../controllers/resourceControllers.js";
import {
  createResourceValidator,
  updateResourceValidator,
  resourceIdValidator,
} from "../middlewares/validators/resourceValidators.js";

const router = express.Router();

// All routes require authentication
router.use(verifyJWT);

// List resources (read permission)
router.get("/", authorize("Resource", "read"), getResources);

// Get single resource (read permission)
router.get(
  "/:resourceId",
  resourceIdValidator,
  authorize("Resource", "read"),
  getResource
);

// Create resource (create permission)
router.post(
  "/",
  createResourceValidator,
  authorize("Resource", "create"),
  createResource
);

// Update resource (update permission)
router.put(
  "/:resourceId",
  updateResourceValidator,
  authorize("Resource", "update"),
  updateResource
);

// Delete resource (delete permission)
router.delete(
  "/:resourceId",
  resourceIdValidator,
  authorize("Resource", "delete"),
  deleteResource
);

// Restore resource (update permission)
router.patch(
  "/:resourceId/restore",
  resourceIdValidator,
  authorize("Resource", "update"),
  restoreResource
);

export default router;
```

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER AND DEPENDENCIES

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Core → Models → Routes → Validators → Controllers)

**Phase 1.0: Backend Core Foundation (NO Models/Controllers/Routes Yet)**

**CRITICAL:** Build ALL foundational infrastructure BEFORE creating any models, controllers, or routes.

**Step 1.0.1: Project Setup**

- Initialize backend with ES modules (`"type": "module"`)
- Install all dependencies from package.json
- Create complete folder structure exactly as specified
- Setup environment variables (.env file)

**Step 1.0.2: Configuration Files**

- `config/db.js` - MongoDB connection with retry logic, connection pooling (min: 2, max: 10), health check monitoring
- `config/allowedOrigins.js` - CORS allowed origins list
- `config/corsOptions.js` - CORS configuration with validation
- `config/authorizationMatrix.json` - Role-based permissions (ONLY source of truth)

**Step 1.0.3: Error Handling Infrastructure**

- `errorHandler/CustomError.js` - Custom error class with status codes and error codes
- `errorHandler/ErrorController.js` - Global error handler middleware

**CustomError Class Structure:**

The CustomError class provides consistent error handling with standardized error codes and status codes:

```javascript
class CustomError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message,
    statusCode = 500,
    errorCode = "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
    context = {}
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.errorCode = errorCode;
    this.context = context;
    this.isOperational = true;
    Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
  }

  /**
   * Create a validation error with consistent error code
   */
  static validation(message, context = {}) {
    return new CustomError(message, 400, "VALIDATION_ERROR", context);
  }

  /**
   * Create an authentication error with consistent error code (logout on frontend)
   */
  static authentication(message, context = {}) {
    return new CustomError(message, 401, "AUTHENTICATION_ERROR", context);
  }

  /**
   * Create an authorization error with consistent error code
   */
  static authorization(message, context = {}) {
    return new CustomError(message, 403, "AUTHORIZATION_ERROR", context);
  }

  /**
   * Create a not found error with consistent error code
   */
  static notFound(message, context = {}) {
    return new CustomError(message, 404, "NOT_FOUND_ERROR", context);
  }

  /**
   * Create a conflict error with consistent error code
   */
  static conflict(message, context = {}) {
    return new CustomError(message, 409, "CONFLICT_ERROR", context);
  }

  /**
   * Create an internal server error with consistent error code
   */
  static internal(message, context = {}) {
    return new CustomError(message, 500, "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR", context);
  }
}
```

**Error Code Standards:**

- `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400) - Invalid input data, validation failures
- `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` (401) - Invalid credentials, expired tokens (triggers logout on frontend)
- `AUTHORIZATION_ERROR` (403) - Insufficient permissions, forbidden access
- `NOT_FOUND_ERROR` (404) - Resource not found
- `CONFLICT_ERROR` (409) - Duplicate resources, uniqueness violations
- `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500) - Unexpected server errors

**Usage in Controllers:**

```javascript
// Validation error
throw CustomError.validation("Invalid email format");

// Authentication error (triggers logout on frontend)
throw CustomError.authentication("Invalid credentials");

// Authorization error
throw CustomError.authorization("Insufficient permissions");

// Not found error
throw CustomError.notFound("User not found");

// Conflict error
throw CustomError.conflict("Email already exists");

// Internal server error
throw CustomError.internal("Database connection failed");
```

**Step 1.0.4: Utility Functions**

- `utils/constants.js` - ALL constants (ONLY source of truth) - MUST be created FIRST
- `utils/logger.js` - Winston logger configuration (file and console transports)
- `utils/helpers.js` - Utility helper functions
- `utils/generateTokens.js` - JWT token generation functions
- `utils/validateEnv.js` - Environment variable validation
- `utils/authorizationMatrix.js` - Authorization helper functions
- `utils/responseTransform.js` - Response formatting utilities
- `utils/materialTransform.js` - Material data transformation
- `utils/userStatus.js` - User status tracking utilities
- `utils/dateUtils.js` - **Timezone management utilities (UTC conversion, ISO formatting)**

**Step 1.0.5: Middleware (Non-Validator)**

- `middlewares/authMiddleware.js` - JWT verification (verifyJWT, verifyRefreshToken)
- `middlewares/authorization.js` - Role-based authorization middleware
- `middlewares/rateLimiter.js` - Rate limiting (production only)

**Step 1.0.6: Services**

- `services/emailService.js` - Nodemailer, Gmail SMTP, queue-based email sending
- `services/notificationService.js` - Notification creation and management

**Step 1.0.7: Email Templates**

- `templates/emailTemplates.js` - HTML email templates (welcome, password reset, notifications)

**Step 1.0.8: Socket.IO Infrastructure**

- `utils/socketInstance.js` - Socket.IO singleton pattern
- `utils/socket.js` - Socket.IO event handlers (connection, disconnection, rooms)
- `utils/socketEmitter.js` - Socket.IO event emitters (task, activity, comment, notification events)

**Step 1.0.9: Soft Delete Plugin (CRITICAL - Universal Dependency)**

- `models/plugins/softDelete.js` - Universal soft delete functionality
- Implement all query helpers: `withDeleted()`, `onlyDeleted()`
- Implement instance methods: `softDelete()`, `restore()`
- Implement static methods: `softDeleteById()`, `softDeleteMany()`, `restoreById()`, `restoreMany()`, `findDeletedByIds()`, `countDeleted()`, `ensureTTLIndex()`, `getRestoreAudit()`
- TTL index configuration
- Hard delete protection (block deleteOne, deleteMany, findOneAndDelete, remove)

**Step 1.0.10: App Configuration**

- `app.js` - Express app setup with security middleware order (helmet, cors, cookieParser, express.json, mongoSanitize, compression, rateLimiter)
- Error handling middleware
- Static file serving (production)
- **Timezone configuration: Set process.env.TZ = 'UTC'**

**Step 1.0.11: Server Startup**

- `server.js` - HTTP server creation, Socket.IO initialization, graceful shutdown
- Database connection
- **Timezone enforcement: Verify UTC timezone**

**Phase 1.1: Models (In Dependency Order)**

**CRITICAL:** ALL models MUST include:

- `import mongoosePaginate from 'mongoose-paginate-v2';`
- `import softDeletePlugin from './plugins/softDelete.js';`
- Schema options with timestamps, versionKey: false, toJSON/toObject transforms
- Session support in all hooks and methods

- TTL index: `Model.ensureTTLIndex(expireAfterSeconds)` after model creation
- **Date field handling: Automatic UTC conversion with dayjs**

**Model Creation Order:**

1. **Organization** (no dependencies) - Platform vs Customer organization
2. **Department** (depends on: Organization)
3. **User** (depends on: Organization, Department) - Role, HOD flag, platform flag
4. **Vendor** (depends on: Department, Organization, User) - External clients for ProjectTasks

## TIMEZONE MANAGEMENT SETUP

### Overview

**CRITICAL:** This Multi-Tenant SaaS Task Manager serves users worldwide. Proper timezone management ensures all users see dates and times correctly for their location while maintaining data consistency.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Store in UTC**: All database dates stored in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time)
2. **Convert at Boundaries**:
   - Frontend → Backend: Local time → UTC
   - Backend → Frontend: UTC → Local time
3. **Use ISO Format**: Standardized date communication (ISO 8601)
4. **Dayjs Consistency**: Use same dayjs setup across frontend and backend

### Backend Timezone Configuration

**Step 1: Server Timezone Setup**

**File:** `backend/server.js`

```javascript
// Set server timezone to UTC (CRITICAL - Must be first)
process.env.TZ = "UTC";

// Verify timezone is set correctly
console.log("Server Timezone:", new Date().toString());
console.log("UTC Time:", new Date().toISOString());
```

**Step 2: Dayjs Configuration**

**File:** `backend/utils/dateUtils.js`

```javascript
import dayjs from "dayjs";
import utc from "dayjs/plugin/utc.js";
import timezone from "dayjs/plugin/timezone.js";

// Extend dayjs with plugins
dayjs.extend(utc);
dayjs.extend(timezone);

// Utility functions for backend
export const toUTC = (date) => {
  return dayjs(date).utc().toDate();
};

export const formatISO = (date) => {
  return dayjs(date).utc().toISOString();
};

export const isValidDate = (date) => {
  return dayjs(date).isValid();
};

export default dayjs;
```

**Step 3: Mongoose Schema Date Handling**

**All Models with Date Fields:**

```javascript
import dayjs from "../utils/dateUtils.js";

// Pre-save hook to convert dates to UTC
schemaName.pre("save", function (next) {
  // Convert all date fields to UTC before saving
  if (this.dueDate) {
    this.dueDate = dayjs(this.dueDate).utc().toDate();
  }
  if (this.startDate) {
    this.startDate = dayjs(this.startDate).utc().toDate();
  }
  // Add other date fields as needed
  next();
});

// Schema options for JSON transformation
const schemaOptions = {
  timestamps: true, // createdAt and updatedAt in UTC
  toJSON: {
    virtuals: true,
    transform: (doc, ret) => {
      // Convert dates to ISO strings for API responses
      if (ret.dueDate) ret.dueDate = dayjs(ret.dueDate).utc().toISOString();
      if (ret.startDate)
        ret.startDate = dayjs(ret.startDate).utc().toISOString();
      if (ret.createdAt)
        ret.createdAt = dayjs(ret.createdAt).utc().toISOString();
      if (ret.updatedAt)
        ret.updatedAt = dayjs(ret.updatedAt).utc().toISOString();
      delete ret.id;
      return ret;
    },
  },
};
```

**Step 4: Controller Date Handling**

**All Controllers with Date Input:**

```javascript
import dayjs from "../utils/dateUtils.js";

export const createTask = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  const { startDate, dueDate, ...otherFields } = req.validated.body;

  // Convert incoming dates to UTC before saving
  const taskData = {
    ...otherFields,
    startDate: startDate ? dayjs(startDate).utc().toDate() : undefined,
    dueDate: dueDate ? dayjs(dueDate).utc().toDate() : undefined,
  };

  // Create task with UTC dates
  const task = await Task.create([taskData], { session });

  // Response will have ISO strings (handled by toJSON transform)
  res.status(201).json({
    success: true,
    task: task[0],
  });
});
```

**Step 5: API Response Format**

**All API Responses:**

- Dates returned as ISO 8601 strings (e.g., `"2024-12-13T10:30:00.000Z"`)
- Handled automatically by Mongoose `toJSON` transform
- Consistent format for all date fields

### Frontend Timezone Configuration

// Extend dayjs with plugins
dayjs.extend(utc);
dayjs.extend(timezone);
dayjs.extend(relativeTime);
dayjs.extend(customParseFormat);

  return dayjs.tz(localDate, getUserTimezone()).utc().toISOString();
};

/**
 * Format date for display in UI
 * @param {string|Date} date - Date to format
 * @param {string} format - Format string (default: 'MMM DD, YYYY HH:mm')
 * @returns {string} Formatted date string
 */
export const formatDateForDisplay = (date, format = "MMM DD, YYYY HH:mm") => {
  if (!date) return "";
  return convertUTCToLocal(date).format(format);
};

/**
 * Format date for API (ISO string in UTC)
 * @param {string|Date} date - Date to format
 * @returns {string} ISO string in UTC
 */
export const formatDateForAPI = (date) => {
  if (!date) return null;
  return dayjs(date).utc().toISOString();
};

};

export default dayjs;
```

**Step 2: API Service Layer Date Transformation**

**File:** `client/src/redux/features/api.js`

```javascript
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";
import { convertLocalToUTC, convertUTCToLocal } from "../../utils/dateUtils";

// Transform request data (local → UTC)
const transformRequest = (body) => {
  if (!body) return body;

  const transformed = { ...body };

  // Convert date fields to UTC
  if (transformed.startDate) {
    transformed.startDate = convertLocalToUTC(transformed.startDate);
  }
  if (transformed.dueDate) {
    transformed.dueDate = convertLocalToUTC(transformed.dueDate);
  }
  // Add other date fields as needed

  return transformed;
};

// Transform response data (UTC → local for display)
const transformResponse = (response) => {
  if (!response) return response;

  // Handle single resource
  if (response.task) {
    return {
      ...response,
      task: transformDates(response.task),
    };
  }

  // Handle array of resources
  if (response.tasks) {
    return {
      ...response,
      tasks: response.tasks.map(transformDates),
    };
  }

  return response;
};

// Transform date fields in a single object
const transformDates = (obj) => {
  if (!obj) return obj;

  const transformed = { ...obj };

  // Note: Keep dates as ISO strings in Redux state
  // Convert to local only when displaying in components

  return transformed;
};

export const api = createApi({
  reducerPath: "api",
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL,
    credentials: "include",
    prepareHeaders: (headers) => {
      headers.set("Content-Type", "application/json");
      return headers;
    },
  }),
  tagTypes: [
    /* ... */
  ],
  endpoints: () => ({}),
});
```

**Step 3: MUI DatePicker Integration**

**File:** `client/src/components/common/MuiDatePicker.jsx`

```javascript
import { Controller } from "react-hook-form";
import { DatePicker } from "@mui/x-date-pickers/DatePicker";
import { LocalizationProvider } from "@mui/x-date-pickers/LocalizationProvider";
import { AdapterDayjs } from "@mui/x-date-pickers/AdapterDayjs";
import {
  convertUTCToLocal,
  convertLocalToUTC,
  getUserTimezone,
} from "../../utils/dateUtils";
import dayjs from "dayjs";

const MuiDatePicker = ({ name, control, label, rules, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>
      <Controller
        name={name}
        control={control}
        rules={rules}
        render={({
          field: { onChange, value, ...fieldProps },
          fieldState: { error },
        }) => (
          <DatePicker
            {...fieldProps}
            {...props}
            label={label}
            value={value ? convertUTCToLocal(value) : null}
            onChange={(newValue) => {
              // Convert local time to UTC for form state
              onChange(newValue ? convertLocalToUTC(newValue) : null);
            }}
            timezone={getUserTimezone()}
            slotProps={{
              textField: {
                error: !!error,
                helperText: error?.message,
                fullWidth: true,
              },
            }}
          />
        )}
      />
    </LocalizationProvider>
  );
};

export default MuiDatePicker;
```

**Step 4: Component Date Display**

**All Components Displaying Dates:**

```javascript
import { formatDateForDisplay, getRelativeTime } from "../../utils/dateUtils";

const TaskCard = ({ task }) => {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardContent>
        <Typography variant="h6">{task.title}</Typography>

        {/* Display date in user's local timezone */}
        <Typography variant="body2">
          Due: {formatDateForDisplay(task.dueDate, "MMM DD, YYYY HH:mm")}
        </Typography>

        {/* Display relative time */}
        <Typography variant="caption">
          Created {getRelativeTime(task.createdAt)}
        </Typography>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

**Step 5: Form Date Handling**

**All Forms with Date Fields:**

```javascript
import { useForm, Controller } from "react-hook-form";
import MuiDatePicker from "../common/MuiDatePicker";
import { convertLocalToUTC } from "../../utils/dateUtils";

const CreateUpdateTask = ({ task }) => {
  const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      title: task?.title || "",
      // Dates stored as ISO strings in form state
      startDate: task?.startDate || null,
      dueDate: task?.dueDate || null,
    },
  });

  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    // Dates are already in UTC ISO format from MuiDatePicker
    // No additional conversion needed
    await createTask(data).unwrap();
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <MuiDatePicker
        name="startDate"
        control={control}
        label="Start Date"
        rules={{ required: "Start date is required" }}
      />

      <MuiDatePicker
        name="dueDate"
        control={control}
        label="Due Date"
        rules={{ required: "Due date is required" }}
      />
    </form>
  );
};
```

### Timezone Management Verification Checklist

**Backend Verification:**

- [ ] Server timezone set to UTC in `server.js`
- [ ] Dayjs configured with UTC and timezone plugins
- [ ] All models convert dates to UTC in pre-save hooks
- [ ] All models return ISO strings in `toJSON` transform
- [ ] All controllers convert incoming dates to UTC
- [ ] Mongoose timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) are in UTC
- [ ] API responses return dates as ISO strings

**Frontend Verification:**

- [ ] Dayjs configured with UTC and timezone plugins
- [ ] Date utility functions created and working
- [ ] User timezone detected correctly
- [ ] MuiDatePicker converts UTC ↔ local automatically
- [ ] All date displays use `formatDateForDisplay()`
- [ ] All API calls convert local → UTC before sending
- [ ] Form date inputs work correctly across timezones
- [ ] Relative time displays correctly (e.g., "2 hours ago")

**Integration Verification:**

- [ ] Create task with due date in one timezone, view in another timezone - dates match
- [ ] Task deadlines display correctly for users in different timezones
- [ ] Date filters work correctly across timezones
- [ ] Sorting by date works correctly
- [ ] Date range queries return correct results
- [ ] No timezone conflicts in API communication

### Expected Outcome

After implementing this timezone management system:

1. **Users worldwide see correct dates**: All dates displayed in user's local timezone
2. **Data consistency**: All dates stored in UTC in database
3. **No timezone bugs**: Automatic conversion at boundaries prevents timezone issues
4. **Transparent to users**: Users don't need to think about timezones
5. **Developer-friendly**: Clear patterns for handling dates throughout the application

---

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Task Types and Material Handling

**ProjectTask (Outsourced to Vendor):**

- Purpose: Department task outsourced to external vendor/client
- Required Field: `vendor` (ref: Vendor)
- Materials: Added via TaskActivity with attachments as proof
- TaskActivity: YES - Department users log vendor's work progress
- All Statuses: To Do, In Progress, Completed, Pending
- All Priorities: Low, Medium, High, Urgent

**RoutineTask (From Outlet):**

- Purpose: Daily routine task received by department user from organization outlet
- Required Fields: `startDate`, `dueDate`
- Materials: Added DIRECTLY to RoutineTask (NO TaskActivity intermediary)
- TaskActivity: NO - Materials added directly to task
- Status Restriction: Cannot be "To Do" (must be In Progress, Completed, or Pending)
- Priority Restriction: Cannot be "Low" (must be Medium, High, or Urgent)

**AssignedTask (To User(s)):**

- Purpose: Task assigned to single user or group of users
- Required Field: `assignees` (ref: User or array of Users)
- Materials: Added via TaskActivity with attachments as proof
- TaskActivity: YES - Assigned users log their own work progress
- All Statuses: To Do, In Progress, Completed, Pending
- All Priorities: Low, Medium, High, Urgent

### HOD (Head of Department) Rules

**Definition:** Users with SuperAdmin or Admin roles are automatically HOD

**Characteristics:**

- `isHod: true` for SuperAdmin and Admin roles (automatically set)
- `isHod: false` for Manager and User roles (automatically set)
- Uniqueness: Only ONE HOD per department (enforced by unique index)
- Special Privilege: Only HOD users can be watchers on ProjectTasks
- Deletion Protection: Cannot delete last HOD in department

**Automatic Updates:**

- Changing user role to SuperAdmin/Admin automatically sets `isHod: true`
- Changing user role to Manager/User automatically sets `isHod: false`
- Pre-save hook handles automatic updates

### Platform vs Customer Organizations

**Platform Organization:**

- Identifier: `isPlatformOrg: true` (immutable)
- Purpose: Service provider managing the system
- Quantity: ONLY ONE
- Creation: Backend seed data
- Users: All have `isPlatformUser: true`
- Access: Platform SuperAdmin can view/manage ALL customer organizations
- Deletion: CANNOT be deleted

**Customer Organization:**

- Identifier: `isPlatformOrg: false` (default)
- Purpose: Regular tenant organizations
- Quantity: Multiple
- Creation: Frontend registration
- Users: All have `isPlatformUser: false`
- Access: Isolated from other customer organizations
- Deletion: CAN be deleted (soft delete with cascade)

### CustomError Usage Rules

**CRITICAL:** Always use CustomError static helper methods for consistent error handling:

**✅ Correct Usage:**

```javascript
// Validation errors (400)
throw CustomError.validation("Invalid email format");
throw CustomError.validation("Password must be at least 8 characters");

// Authentication errors (401) - triggers logout on frontend
throw CustomError.authentication("Invalid credentials");
throw CustomError.authentication("Token expired");

// Authorization errors (403)
throw CustomError.authorization(
  "Insufficient permissions to update this resource"
);
throw CustomError.authorization(
  "Only HOD users can be watchers on ProjectTasks"
);

// Not found errors (404)
throw CustomError.notFound("User not found");
throw CustomError.notFound("Resource not found");

// Conflict errors (409)
throw CustomError.conflict("Email already exists");
throw CustomError.conflict("Resource already exists");

// Internal server errors (500)
throw CustomError.internal("Database connection failed");
throw CustomError.internal("Unexpected error occurred");
```

**❌ Wrong Usage:**

```javascript
// Don't use constructor directly
throw new CustomError("User not found", 404, "NOT_FOUND_ERROR");

// Don't use generic Error
throw new Error("User not found");

// Don't use inconsistent error codes
throw new CustomError("User not found", 404, "USER_NOT_FOUND");
```

**Error Code Standards:**

- `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400) - Invalid input, validation failures
- `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` (401) - Invalid credentials, expired tokens (triggers logout on frontend)
- `AUTHORIZATION_ERROR` (403) - Insufficient permissions, forbidden access
- `NOT_FOUND_ERROR` (404) - Resource not found
- `CONFLICT_ERROR` (409) - Duplicate resources, uniqueness violations
- `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500) - Unexpected server errors

### MUI v7 Breaking Changes

**Grid Component:**

```jsx
// ❌ Wrong (MUI v5/v6)
<Grid container>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>Content</Grid>
</Grid>

// ✅ Correct (MUI v7)
<Grid container>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>Content</Grid>
</Grid>
```

**Dialog Accessibility:**

```jsx
// ✅ Required Props
<Dialog
  disableEnforceFocus
  disableRestoreFocus
  aria-labelledby="dialog-title"
  aria-describedby="dialog-description"
>
  <DialogTitle id="dialog-title">Title</DialogTitle>
  <DialogContent id="dialog-description">Content</DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

### React Hook Form Rules

**❌ NEVER use watch() method:**

```jsx
// ❌ Wrong
const { watch } = useForm();
const watchedValue = watch("fieldName");

// ✅ Correct
const { control } = useForm();
<Controller
  name="fieldName"
  control={control}
  render={({ field }) => <MuiTextField {...field} />}
/>;
```

### Pagination Conversion

**Backend (mongoose-paginate-v2):** 1-based pages

**Frontend (MUI DataGrid):** 0-based pages

**Conversion:**

- Frontend → Backend: `page + 1`
- Backend → Frontend: `page - 1`

**MuiDataGrid Component:** Automatically handles conversion

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS SUMMARY

### Schema Implementation Checklist

**Every Schema MUST Include:**

1. **Required Imports:**

   - `import mongoose from 'mongoose';`
   - `import mongoosePaginate from 'mongoose-paginate-v2';`
   - `import softDeletePlugin from './plugins/softDelete.js';`

2. **Schema Options:**

   ```javascript
   {
     timestamps: true,
     versionKey: false,
     toJSON: {
       virtuals: true,
       transform: (doc, ret) => {
         delete ret.id;
         return ret;
       },
     },
     toObject: {
       virtuals: true,
       transform: (doc, ret) => {
         delete ret.id;
         return ret;
       },
     },
   }
   ```

3. **Session Support:**

   - All hooks MUST support session: `this.$session()`
   - All instance methods MUST accept `{ session }` parameter
   - All static methods MUST accept `{ session }` parameter

4. **Plugin Application:**

   - `schemaName.plugin(mongoosePaginate);`
   - `schemaName.plugin(softDeletePlugin);`

5. **TTL Index:**
   - `ModelName.ensureTTLIndex(expireAfterSeconds);` after model creation

### Controller Implementation Checklist

**Every Write Controller MUST:**

1. **Extract User Context:**

   ```javascript
   const {
     _id: userId,
     role,
     organization,
     department,
     isPlatformUser,
     isHod,
     isPlatformOrg,
   } = req.user;
   ```

2. **Extract Validated Data:**

   ```javascript
   const { field1, field2 } = req.validated.body;
   const { resourceId } = req.validated.params;
   const { page, limit } = req.validated.query;
   ```

3. **Use Transaction:**

   ```javascript
   const session = await mongoose.startSession();
   session.startTransaction();
   try {
     // All database operations with { session }
     await session.commitTransaction();
   } catch (error) {
     await session.abortTransaction();
     throw error;
   } finally {
     session.endSession();
   }
   ```

4. **Use CustomError Static Methods:**

   ```javascript
   // Validation errors
   throw CustomError.validation("Invalid input data");

   // Authentication errors (triggers logout on frontend)
   throw CustomError.authentication("Invalid credentials");

   // Authorization errors
   throw CustomError.authorization("Insufficient permissions");

   // Not found errors
   throw CustomError.notFound("Resource not found");

   // Conflict errors
   throw CustomError.conflict("Resource already exists");

   // Internal server errors
   throw CustomError.internal("Unexpected error occurred");
   ```

5. **Return Standardized Response:**
   ```javascript
   res.status(200).json({
     success: true,
     pagination: {
       /* pagination metadata */
     },
     resource: result.docs,
   });
   ```

### Validator Implementation Checklist

**Every Validator MUST:**

1. **Validate Field Types and Values:**

   - Use appropriate validators (isEmail, isMongoId, isLength, etc.)
   - Apply constraints (min, max, enum values)

2. **Check Existence with withDeleted:**

   ```javascript
   .custom(async (value) => {
     const doc = await Model.findById(value).withDeleted();
     if (!doc) throw new Error('Not found');
     if (doc.isDeleted) throw new Error('Document is deleted');
     return true;
   })
   ```

3. **Check Uniqueness with withDeleted:**

   ```javascript
   .custom(async (value, { req }) => {
     const existing = await Model.findOne({ field: value }).withDeleted();
     if (existing && existing._id.toString() !== req.params.id) {
       throw new Error('Already exists');
     }
     return true;
   })
   ```

4. **Set req.validated:**
   ```javascript
   export const handleValidationErrors = (req, res, next) => {
     req.validated = {
       body: matchedData(req, { locations: ["body"] }),
       params: matchedData(req, { locations: ["params"] }),
       query: matchedData(req, { locations: ["query"] }),
     };
     next();
   };
   ```

### Permission Fields Usage

**Every Query MUST Consider:**

1. **Organization Isolation:**

   - Filter by `organizationId` (except platform SuperAdmin with crossOrg)

2. **Department Isolation:**

   - Filter by `departmentId` for Manager/User roles

3. **Ownership:**

   - Check `createdBy`, `addedBy`, `uploadedBy` for update/delete operations

4. **Role-Based Scope:**

   - Use `role` field to determine authorization scope

5. **Platform Flag:**

   - Check `isPlatformOrg` and `isPlatformUser` for crossOrg access

6. **HOD Flag:**

   - Check `isHod` for watcher eligibility on ProjectTasks

7. **Assignment:**
   - Check `assignees` for task access

### Testing Implementation Checklist

**Every Test MUST:**

1. **Use Real MongoDB:**

   - NEVER use mongodb-memory-server
   - Connect to real test database
   - Use `MONGODB_URI_TEST` environment variable

2. **Clean Up:**

   - Drop collections after each test
   - Drop database after test suite
   - Close connections properly

3. **Use Transactions:**

   - Test transaction rollback scenarios
   - Verify cascade operations

4. **Test Soft Delete:**
   - Test soft delete functionality
   - Test withDeleted() and onlyDeleted() helpers
   - Test restore functionality

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES SUMMARY

### Backend Implementation Order

**Phase 1.0: Core Foundation (FIRST)**

- Configuration files (db, cors, authorization matrix)
- Error handling infrastructure
- Utility functions (constants FIRST, then logger, helpers, tokens, dateUtils)
- Middleware (auth, authorization, rate limiter)
- Services (email, notification)
- Email templates
- Socket.IO infrastructure
- Soft delete plugin (CRITICAL)
- App and server setup with UTC timezone

**Phase 1.1: Models (SECOND)**

- Create all 13 models in dependency order
- Each model MUST include: mongoosePaginate, softDeletePlugin, session support, UTC date handling
- Organization → Department → User → Vendor → Material → BaseTask → ProjectTask/RoutineTask/AssignedTask → TaskActivity → TaskComment → Attachment → Notification

**Phase 1.2: Routes → Validators → Controllers (THIRD)**

- For EACH resource, implement in order: Routes → Validators → Controllers
- Validators MUST use withDeleted() for existence/uniqueness checks
- Controllers MUST use transactions for write operations
- Controllers MUST use req.validated for data extraction
- Implementation order: Auth → Organization → Department → User → Vendor → Material → Task → TaskActivity → TaskComment → Attachment → Notification

**Phase 1.3: Route Aggregation (FOURTH)**

- Aggregate all routes in routes/index.js
- Test all endpoints

### Frontend Implementation Order

**Phase 2.0: Core Foundation (FIRST)**

- Project setup
- Constants (MUST mirror backend exactly)
- Utility functions (errorHandler, dateUtils with timezone management)
- Services (socket, cloudinary)
- Hooks (useSocket, useAuth)
- Theme infrastructure (primitives, provider, customizations)

**Phase 2.1: Redux Store (SECOND)**

- Base API configuration with date transformation
- Auth slice
- Store configuration with persistence

**Phase 2.2: Redux API Endpoints (THIRD)**

- Create all 11 API endpoints in dependency order
- Each endpoint MUST handle date conversion (local ↔ UTC)
- Auth → Organization → Department → User → Vendor → Material → Task → TaskActivity → TaskComment → Attachment → Notification

**Phase 2.3: Common Components (FOURTH)**

- Form components (including MuiDatePicker with UTC ↔ local conversion)
- DataGrid components (with pagination conversion)
- Filter components (including FilterDateRange with timezone handling)
- Dialog components
- Loading components
- Utility components

**Phase 2.4: Resource-Specific Components (FIFTH)**

- For each resource: Columns → Cards → Lists → Filters → Forms
- All cards MUST use React.memo, useCallback, useMemo
- All forms MUST use React Hook Form with Controller (NO watch())

**Phase 2.5: Layouts (SIXTH)**

- RootLayout, PublicLayout, DashboardLayout
- ProtectedRoute, PublicRoute

**Phase 2.6: Pages (SEVENTH)**

- Public pages: Home, Login, Register, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword
- Protected pages: Dashboard, Organizations, Departments, Users, Materials, Vendors, Tasks, TaskDetail, NotFound

**Phase 2.7: Routing (EIGHTH)**

- Route configuration with lazy loading
- Nested routes for layouts

**Phase 2.8: App Entry Point (NINTH)**

- App.jsx with theme, Redux, router, Socket.IO, toast, error boundary
- main.jsx with React DOM render

### Critical Implementation Rules

**Backend:**

1. ✅ Build core foundation BEFORE models
2. ✅ Create models BEFORE controllers
3. ✅ Create routes → validators → controllers for EACH resource
4. ✅ Use transactions for ALL write operations
5. ✅ Use withDeleted() for existence/uniqueness checks
6. ✅ Convert dates to UTC before saving
7. ✅ Return dates as ISO strings
8. ✅ Set server timezone to UTC

**Frontend:**

1. ✅ Build core foundation BEFORE Redux
2. ✅ Create Redux store BEFORE components
3. ✅ Create common components BEFORE resource-specific components
4. ✅ Use MuiDatePicker with automatic UTC ↔ local conversion
5. ✅ Display dates using formatDateForDisplay()
6. ✅ Convert local dates to UTC before API calls
7. ✅ Use React.memo, useCallback, useMemo for performance
8. ✅ NEVER use watch() in React Hook Form

**Timezone Management:**

1. ✅ Store ALL dates in UTC in database
2. ✅ Convert at boundaries (frontend ↔ backend)
3. ✅ Use ISO format for API communication
4. ✅ Display dates in user's local timezone
5. ✅ Use dayjs consistently across frontend and backend

**Testing:**

1. ✅ NEVER use mongodb-memory-server
2. ✅ Use real MongoDB test database
3. ✅ Test transaction rollback scenarios
4. ✅ Test soft delete functionality
5. ✅ Test timezone conversion
